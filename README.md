## Prios

This priority list is a whitelist of programming resources to spend thoughts and time on.
Goal of this is to keep focus on a few tasks and only move to other tasks once these have
been crossed off. The list may not contain more than three items at any given time.

1. vim
  - sharpen and enhance skill set
  
2. mobile game
  - make responsive
  - add gamepad controls
  - turn into PWA
